# Drew's React Slider

 My own custom slider component. Based on a few online tutorials, primarily [this one by Robin Wieruch](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-slider/).
 
 Uses [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for the styling and provides some flexible options for track coloring and thumb style.
